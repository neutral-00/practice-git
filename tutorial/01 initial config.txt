```

## help on global config

$ git config -h
$ git help config

- any other command help u can get with: git help {command}


## why set user.email
Setting the user.email in Git global configuration is not mandatory, but it is recommended to do so. 
The user.email is used to associate your commits with your email address, which is useful for tracking changes and collaborating with others 
1. If you don’t set your email address, Git will prompt you to set it when you try to commit changes 
2. To set your email address globally, you can use the following command:

git config --global user.email "you@example.com"

This will set your email address for all repositories on your system that don’t have repository-specific values 
1. You can also set the email address for a specific repository by running the same command without the --global option 
from within the repository directory.
